		<h1>City-States in the Ancient Near East</h1>
		
		<h2>Introductory Concerns</h2>
		
		<img src="map.svg" title="The Near East. Note that the Persian Gulf has moved quite a lot southward since antiquity.">
		
		<h3>Prehistoric Developments</h3>
		<p>Agriculture began, and a part of the population gradually settled down in agricultural villages. Where rainfall was not optimal for farming, irrigation began. When communities grew, hierarchies appeared, and powers and function were centralized, the physical focus of which was a temple.</p>
		
		<h2>Origins: The Uruk Phenomenon</h2>

		<h3>The Origin of Cities</h3>
		<p>The settled population of Mesopotamia grew, and the Sumerian Uruk, in the very south of Mesopotamia, became the first true city. In it, some people started to specialize in non-agricultural labor, making things like the mass-produced beveled-rim bowls or the expertly crafted cylinder seals, creating a new social hierarchy based on profession, and making exchange necessary, causing the creation of an economic organization in which the temple was central in collecting and redistributing goods.</p> 
		
		<h3>The Development of Writing and Administration</h3>
		<p>The temple needed administrators to keep track of things. With each transaction, they recorded two things: the people and the quantities involved. The people were identified first with stamp seals, then cylinder seals. The quantites were recorded in two ways: the first was with tokens in bullae. Problem: you need to break them to see what’s inside. Solution: use the tokens to make markings on the outside. This method died out in favor of the other method: numerical tablets. Problem: you don’t know what’s being counted. Solution: make drawings of the things you’re counting. These drawing became proto-cuneiform in Uruk and the undeciphered proto-Elamite in Susa. Measures, numbers and months were also standardized to make accounting function properly.</p>
		
		<h3>The “Uruk Expansion”</h3>
		<p>To the east, Uruk completely influenced the material culture of Susa, a center which had appeared independantly, which in turn spread Uruk’s culture further in Iran. Uruk’s cultural influence in the north was of varying degrees, from complete influence in “colonies” of southerners, to no influence at all. More important than Uruk’s material culture is the social change it caused: the new social hierarchy and the economic organization. But it wasn’t all foreign influence: indigenous evolution also played a role. Uruk “expanded” for two reasons: the new hierarchy had created a social elite who wanted exotic materials, and the city-god was seen as having influence that went well beyond the city and its surroundings.</p>
		
		<h3>Uruk’s Aftermath</h3>
		<p>To the east of southern Mesopotamia, the proto-Elamite state had emerged. Contacts with northern Mesopotamia were cut off, and local traditions reemerged. In southern Mesopotamia itself, instead of one center that dominated, there were now multiple similar-sized centers.</p>

		<h3>The Written Sources and Their Historical Uses</h3>
		<p>Royal inscriptions, a new kind of text, are useful for studying political history. Later literature also looks back on this period, but contemporary sources are the most important. Also, all of these sources are very biased.</p>
		
		<h3>Political Developments in Southern Mesopotamia</h3>
		<p>The political unit in this time was the city-state. When the population grew, city-states started fighting over the agricultural land in between them, which created a new base of power: military competence, chosen by people, associated with a palace, as oppose to managerial competence as chosen by a god and associated with a temple. These conflicting bases of power were eventually harmonized. Even though the land was politically divided, it was culturally unified because of a shared religion, in which every city was seen as the dwelling of a particular god or goddess. The focus of this unified cult shifted from Uruk to Nippur. Southern Mesopotamia was multilingual: the language isolate Sumerian and the Semitic proto-Akkadian were spoken.</p>
		
		<h3>The Wider Near East</h3>
		<p>Early Dynastic Babylonia’s orbit was larger than Uruk’s had been before. It now included the Persion Gulf, which gave acces to Omani copper mines, which were needed for the new technology of bronze. To the east of Babylonia, an indigenous proto-Elamite culture appeared, replacing the earlier Uruk influence. In Northern Mesopotamia and Syria, a new material culture appeared which we call Ninevite 5, which was not urbanized. Later, when cities had emerged, the north was similar to the south, consisting of city-states who interacted with each other, but there were differences: cities were smaller (plenty of rain meant no irrigation meant lower crop yields), and power was secular instead of religious.</p>
		
		<h3>Early Dynastic Society</h3>
		<p>Administrative documents are useful for studying social history. Characteristic of Early Dynastic Society is the organization into “households”. The households were part of a hierarchy of households, and within each household there was a hierarchy. The households ensured the survival of the weak in society. Many workers performed repetitive manual labor. There was also an increase in wealth inequality, which is especially visible to us in the Royal Cemetary of Ur.</p>
		
		<h3>Scribal Culture</h3>
		<p>Outside southern Mesopotamia, proto-writing had died out. In southern Mesopotamia itself, writing was developed further: new kinds of texts were written, and the script evolved: wedges were used instead of lines, syllabic writing was expanded and tablet layouts were standardized. This scribal culture expanded from Babylonia to other regions again.</p>
		
		<h2>Political Centralization in the Late Third Millennium</h2>

		<h3>The Kings of Akkad</h3>
		<p>Through military might, Sargon of Akkad was able to establish hegemony over other city-states in Babylonia. He and his successors pursued centralizing policies. Politically, the rulers of the formerly independent city-states became governors to the king of Akkad. Ideologically, the Akkadian kings tied themselves to the religion by installing daughters as high priestesses in major cults. Economically, cities had to pay taxes, the royal family drew economic resources to itself, and accounting was standardized in an Akkadian way. Outside Babylonia, Akkad had diplomatic ties with other areas. Its influence was so great that its kings started to view themselves differently; Naram-Sin, grandson of Sargon, was the first to be deified during his lifetime. From the beginning, there was opposition to Akkad’s hegemony, and eventually, a mixture of internal and external pressure, like the Gutians, who entered Babylonia from the east and took control over several cities, caused its rapid collapse. Later stories about the kings of Akkad were very positive, but later still, negative views are also expressed.</p>
		
		<h3>The Third Dynasty of Ur</h3>
		<p style="margin-bottom:2em;">After the collapse of Akkad’s hegemony, the Gutians were chased away and Babylonia was reunited under the Third Dynasty of Ur, started by Ur-Namma. It was smaller than the Akkadian Empire, and more centralized. There was taxation, children of kings became high priests and priestesses in major cults, and Ur-Namma’s son, Shulgi, and his succussors were deified while alive. Sumerian literature about heroes like Gilgamesh was likely written in this period. The end of the Ur III hegemony came from the east, and its collapse was smooth for the Babylonian cities, suggesting that their local economies and hierarchies had survived independantly. Different from the Akkadian Empire, later stories about the Ur III dynasty are very negative: it was seen as something that failed.</p>
		
		<!--<h2>The Near East in the Early Second Millennium</h2>
		
		<h3>Nomands and Sedentary People</h3>
		<p>Throughout the Near East, since there was farming, lived semi-nomadic pastoralists, which were called Amorites. Farming and pastoralism were complementary activities, so there was interaction between the groups. Amorites who settled in cities appeared everywhere in the political hierarchy, even as generals in the army. When centralization fell with Ur III, local dynasties competed for power. Some of the new kings claimed Amorite ancestry, like Hammurabi of Babylon, Shamshi-Adad of Assur, and Zimri-Lim of Mari. That their ancestors lived in large territories rather than cities may be why the city-state as the unit of political power started to wane in favor of the territorial state.</p>
		
		<h3>Babylonia</h3>
		
		<p>During the reign of the last king of the Ur III dynasty, Ishbi-Erra had established a dynasty in Isin.</p>
