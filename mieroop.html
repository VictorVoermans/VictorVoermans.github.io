		<h3>1.4&emsp;Prehistoric Developments</h3>
		
		<p><span class="sc">Setting the stage</span> When agriculture began, people became gradually more dependant on the food they controlled rather than the food they hunted and gathered. Eventually, completely agricultural villages existed throughout the Near East. In places where rainfall was not optimal for farming, irrigation systems appeared. When communities grew, hierarchies appeared, along with the centralization of powers and functions, the physical focus of which was a temple.</p>

		<h3>2.1&emsp;The Origins of Cities</h3>
		
		<p><span class="sc">What is a city?</span> The Sumerian Uruk, in the very south of Mesopotamia, was the first true city. But what is a city? It has a few characteristics: it is not isolated, being part of an environment that supports it and benefits from it<!-- (this also applies to the level of monuments within a city)-->; it supplies special items and services, for which people living around the city rely on it; it is where goods are collected and redistributed; and, being the focal point for everyone in a large area, people go to it to meet each other.</p>
		
		<!--<img src="timeline1.svg">-->
		
		<p><span class="sc">How did settlements progress toward cities?</span> First, in the Ubaid Period, the number of settlements in Mesopotamia gradually increased, and they started to differentiate in size. Then, in the Early Uruk Period, several central settlements in the north of Mesopotamia merged into larger settlements with vast open spaces in between them, while the south, where people had settled throughout the countryside, came to be dominated by one settlement: Uruk. The rapid increase in settled population at this time may be due to increased sedentarization of semi-nomadic people, or from outsiders entering the region. In the Late Uruk Period, so many people lived in Uruk‚Äôs orbit that some of them must have migrated from western Iran and northern Mesopotamia.</p>
		
		<p><span class="sc">What happened in Uruk that really made it a city?</span> When Uruk had become the center of its surroundings, some people in the city started to specialize in non-agricultural labor. Examples of things made by specialists are the mass-produced beveled-rim bowls and the expertly crafted cylinder seals. The people who made such things did not make their own food, so exchange was necessary. A system emerged where agricultural producers, who had also started to specialize, exchanged produce for tools and luxury goods. To organize this, authority was required, the foundation of which was religion, an ideology shared by all the participants. The temple was the central institution that made the system work. To collect and redistribute goods, the temple needed a new class of specialists: administrators. To keep track of things in a complex economy, the administrators needed to record things. To record things, they needed writing.</p>
		
		<p><span class="sc">How did this change people‚Äôs lives?</span> A new hierarchy, based on profession, with a ‚Äòpriest-king‚Äô at the top, had emerged among the people who were dependant on the temple: the non-agricultural specialists for their food, the farmers for special items and for insurance against disasters like bad harvests.</p>
		
		<h3>2.2&emsp;The Development of Writing and Administration</h3>
		
		<p><span class="sc">Two ways of accounting</span> Accounts provide two sets of data: a record of quantities, and an identification of the people involved in the transaction. The latter was done with seals, first stamp seals, which had been around for a while, then, in the middle of the Uruk period, they were replaced with cylinder seals. There were two ways of recording quantities: the first was with tokens, which denoted a quantity of a particular item, and were kept in <i>bullae</i>, which were hollow spheres of clay with seals rolled over their surface. Problem: you need to break them to see what‚Äôs inside. Solution: use the tokens to make markings on the outside of the <i>bullae</i>. The second way of recording quantities was with numerical tablets. Problem: you don‚Äôt know exactly <i>what‚Äôs</i> being counted. Solution: make drawings of the things you‚Äôre counting. These drawings became proto-cuneiform in Uruk, and the still undeciphered proto-Elamite in Susiana. Apart from accounts, lexical texts were also found in Uruk, which were intended to teach scribes how to write.</p>
		
		<p><span class="sc">Measures and numbers</span> In the Late Uruk Period, to make accounting function properly, measures were standardized, and a mixture of the sexagesimal and decimal systems were used for the numerals. Apart from weights and lengths, years and months were also standardized. This system laid the foundation for all later Mesopotamian systems.</p>
		
		<h3>2.3&emsp;The ‚ÄúUruk Expansion‚Äù</h3>
		
		<p><span class="sc">Expansion to the east</span> Uruk completely influenced the material culture of Susa, the large center that had emerged independently in the region to the east of southern Mesopotamia, Susiana. Susa extended its culture over a wide area in Iran, taking the southern culture with it.</p>
		
		<p><span class="sc">Expansion to the north</span> In northern Mesopotamia, there were colonies of southern immigrants, the cultures of which were entirely southern, ‚Äòenclaves‚Äô of Uruk people in existing settlements, where the southern culture they brought with them didn‚Äôt replace local traditions, and places where southern influence was completely absent.</p>
		
		<p><span class="sc">What is Uruk culture?</span> More important than the material culture is the social change that the Uruk expansion caused: urban centers appeared with social hierarchies and economic organization. This process is a result of influence from southern Mesopotamia as well as indigenous evolution.</p>
		
		<p><span class="sc">Why did it expand?</span> The new hierarchy had created an elite who wanted exotic materials that weren‚Äôt available in southern Mesopotamia. Ideology also played a role: the city-god had influence over a much larger area than just the city and its surroundings.</p>
		
		<h3>2.4&emsp;Uruk‚Äôs Aftermath</h3>
		
		<p><span class="sc">After the Uruk Period</span> To the east of southern Mesopotamia, the proto-Elamite state had emerged. Contacts with northern Mesopotamia were cut off, and local traditions reemerged. In southern Mesopotamia itself, there were now multiple similar-sized centers, instead of one center that dominated.</p>
