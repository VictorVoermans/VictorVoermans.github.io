			hey.<br><br>when i want to take a shower, i enter this room which is entirely made up of white tiles. all that’s in the room is the shower and me. and a few bottles of shampoo and such, obviously. but it’s mostly the tiles. there’s a tiny window near the ceiling. if i stand on my toes, i can see the ocean down a quiet street with quiet houses. i almost never see a person through that window, it’s so boring. but lately you’ve been there, sitting on this rock. the way you’re staring at the waves, you must have lots to think about. i’m just an ordinary girl. i don’t talk to too many people at school. i don’t know why that is. but having you in my tiny bathroom window makes me feel special in some way. i never have any clothes on when i look at you. do you think that’s weird? tell you what: if you can find my window, look at it for thirty seconds. it’s a small window, the only one of the house where you can see the ocean. you won’t see me because of the way the light works. and you shouldn’t look at multiple windows on the same day, that would be cheating. if i see you’ve got the right one, i’ll get dressed and come down to you. i’ll take a few minutes. then you can tell me what it is you’re thinking about.
