			Laozi, the Old Master, teaches us:<br>
			‘Those who know don’t talk, and those who talk don’t know.’<br>
			<br>
			And I hear them talk, they talk and talk and talk:<br>
			‘That’s how the world works,’ they say.<br>
			<br>
			The whole world, confidently boiled down to one thing:<br>
			It’s all money one day, all power the next.<br>
			<br>
			Easy to understand, it’s all politics and selfishness,<br>
			Never just people living lives and dreaming dreams.<br>
			<br>
			If only they’d stop talking and look around them!<br>
			But why look at the world if you already know what it’s like?<br>
			<br><br><br>
			Solzhenitsyn teaches us:<br>
			‘The line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.’<br>
			<br>
			They point to somewhere and shout angrily,<br>
			‘They are the ones who should do something about it!’<br>
			<br>
			‘I’m just a grain of sand in the desert,’<br>
			Says the whole desert choir.<br>
			<br>
			If you want to fight evil, look for it in yourself.<br>
			And don’t tell me it’s meaningless, you tiny grain of sand,<br>
			<br>
			For how does evil come into this world<br>
			If not through people who don’t fight their own heart?<br>
			<br><br><br>
			Jesus teaches us to love all people.<br>
			‘Oh, how naive!’ they laugh.<br>
			<br>
			But tell me why you would do anything good for the world<br>
			If you hate the terrorists and rapists who inhabit it.<br>
			<br>
			And don’t give such shallow definitions of ‘good’ as ‘pleasing’ or ‘comfortable’;<br>
			Does a mother not punish her child because she loves him?<br>
			<br>
			You must want to shift the line in the hearts of the tyrants and the murderers;<br>
			What good is it to lock them up and throw away the key?<br>
			<br>
			If everyone who strays should fall into the pits you’ve dug,<br>
			Soon the holy path would be empty.<br>
			<br><br><br>
			They talk and they talk and they talk,<br>
			And I hear the talking voices in my own head, too.<br>
			<br>
			These unhelpful thoughts, always consious, I call ‘rocks’;<br>
			Intuition, always unconsious, I call ‘the cicadas’.<br>
			<br>
			Rocks tumble into your head and tell you they know;<br>
			They try to persuade you to do something for them.<br>
			<br>
			The cicadas’ steady chirping is easily drowned out by the talking of the rocks,<br>
			But following their loving guidance impossible to regret.<br>
			<br>
			Empty your head of rocks and listen to the cicadas:<br>
			This is what I teach myself.
